# Lending Club Case Study

### **Assigment by Upgrad and IIIT-B**

This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. ​

If one can identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicant's using EDA is the aim of this case study.​

The Objective of the study is to understand the **driving factors** (or driver variables) behind loan default by using the information  of the past loan applicants.

The case study focuses on EDA mainly, to understand which parameters are major to detect whether a customer will default loan or not. 

Pesented a PPT to illustrate the major parameter to consider while giving loans along their data distributions.
